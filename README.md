##  Getting Started

**System Requirements:**

* **TypeScript**: `version x.y.z`
* **Docker & Docker Compose**
* **Nodejs**
* **Nestjs CLI**

## Installation
### 1. Clone the Git repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Binary-Blade/nest-jo
   cd nest-jo
   ```
### 2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```
### 3. Configure environment variables:
Rename the **.development.env.example** and **.production.env.example** files to **.development.env** and **.production.env**, then update these files with your connection information.
#### Example configuration:
   ```env
    # POSTGRES Docker 
    PGHOST=dev-postgres-host
    PGPORT=5432
    PGDATABASE=dev_database
    PGUSER=dev_user
    PGPASSWORD=dev_password

    # Redis configuration
    REDIS_HOST=dev-redis-host
    REDIS_PORT=6379
    REDIS_PASSWORD=dev_redis_password

    # JWT Configuration
    JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=dev_access_token_secret
    JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRATION=20m
    JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=dev_refresh_token_secret
    JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRATION=30d

    # Server Configuration
    PORT=3000
    NODE_ENV=development

    # Frontend connection
    FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
   ```
### 4. Use Docker containers for development or production:
Using commands via Makefile
#### Development
   To start the containers in development mode:
   ```sh
   make dev
   ```
   To stop the development containers:
   ```sh
   make clean-d
   ```
#### Production
   To start the containers in production mode:
   ```sh
   make prod
   ```
   To stop the production containers:
   ```sh
   make clean-p
   ```
### 5. Run database migrations:
   - Create a new migration:
     ```sh
     make migrate-create
     ```
   - Run the migrations:
     ```sh
     make migrate-run
     ```
   - Revert the last migration:
     ```sh
     make migrate-revert
     ```
### 6. Run tests:

   - Unit tests:
     ```sh
     make test
     ```
